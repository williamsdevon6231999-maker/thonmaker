# Thonmaker – Azure DevSecOps CI/CD (Docker → ACR → App Service)
## SAST (Semgrep) + Container Scanning (Trivy) + DAST (OpenVAS)
## CMMC Level 2 / NIST SP 800-171 (110 Controls) Mapping

Thonmaker is a containerized web application deployed through an **end-to-end Azure DevSecOps pipeline**. 
This repository is built as a **portfolio-grade DevSecOps and security engineering project** demonstrating how **secure CI/CD**, **container security**, and **dynamic vulnerability scanning** are implemented in real-world enterprise environments.

The project integrates **SAST**, **container vulnerability scanning**, and **DAST** using **Semgrep**, **Trivy**, and **OpenVAS**, enforced through **Azure DevOps pipelines** and **self-hosted infrastructure**.

Successful deployment validation page: 
**“Thonmaker Docker CI/CD working!”**

- Docker image build, tagging, and deployment
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** with Semgrep
- **Intentional security gating** (pipeline fails on findings)

- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** with OpenVAS
- Private image storage using **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Flow

1. Developer pushes code to `main`
2. Azure DevOps Pipeline triggers
3. **Semgrep SAST** scans source code 
   - Pipeline **fails intentionally** on findings (security gate)
4. Docker image is built and tagged with `$(Build.BuildId)`
5. **Trivy** scans the container image for HIGH / CRITICAL CVEs
6. Image is pushed to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**
7. **Azure App Service** pulls image using **Managed Identity (AcrPull)**
8. Application is deployed and validated
9. **OpenVAS (DAST)** scans the running service from a dedicated VM

## Technologies Used

- **Azure DevOps Pipelines** – CI/CD automation
- **Self-Hosted Windows Agent** – build & pipeline execution
- **Self-Hosted Linux VM** – security scanning & DAST
- **Docker** – container packaging
- **Semgrep** – SAST (static code analysis)
- **Trivy** – container vulnerability scanning (CVEs)
- **OpenVAS (Greenbone)** – DAST (dynamic vulnerability scanning)
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** – private image registry
- **Azure App Service (Linux Containers)** – application hosting
- **Managed Identity + RBAC** – secure image pulls
- **Git / GitHub** – version control

## Security Testing Strategy

### SAST – Semgrep (Intentional Failure)

Semgrep is configured as a **security gate** in the pipeline.

- Findings **cause the pipeline to fail**
- This behavior is **intentional**
- Demonstrates:
  - Shift-left security
  - Enforced secure coding standards
  - CI/CD security gating

> A failing Semgrep stage indicates successful enforcement, not a broken pipeline.

---

### Container Security – Trivy

- Trivy scans built Docker images
- Detects OS and dependency CVEs
- Focuses on **HIGH and CRITICAL** severity issues
- Results are logged and auditable

---

### DAST – OpenVAS (Greenbone)

Dynamic scanning is performed using **OpenVAS**, running on a **dedicated Azure Linux VM**.

**Why a VM?**
- Realistic enterprise architecture
- Isolated security tooling
- Ability to scan deployed services and infrastructure
- Supports internal and external targets

**Scan Types Used**
- **Fast Scan** – frequent validation
- **Full and Fast Scan** – deep, scheduled assessments

OpenVAS scans:
- Deployed application endpoints
- Network-exposed services
- Misconfigurations and known vulnerabilities

Reports can be exported (PDF / XML / CSV) and used as **audit evidence**.

---

## Self-Hosted Infrastructure

### Azure VM – Security & Agent Host

The Azure VM runs:
- Azure DevOps **self-hosted agent**
- **OpenVAS (Greenbone)** services

This enables:
- Custom tooling
- DAST scans
- Security workloads isolated from managed agents
- Greater control over compliance tooling

---

## How to Demo This Project

1. Push code to the `main` branch
2. Azure DevOps pipeline starts automatically
3. Semgrep runs and **fails intentionally** if findings exist
4. Docker image builds and is scanned with Trivy
5. Image is pushed to ACR
6. App Service deploys the container
7. Application loads successfully
8. OpenVAS runs DAST scans against the live service
9. Results are reviewed and exported as evidence
